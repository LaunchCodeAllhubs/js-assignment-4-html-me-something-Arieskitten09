               <h2>Hiking</h2>
               <p>The best kind of exploration for me is being physically active. In college, I did my best to go on every trip available 
                  to me because like traveling in general, I love seeing and experiencing new things. I may not be able to say I climbed 
                  a cone volcano like my brother &lpar;there was an attempt&rpar;, I've climbed in and out of a gorge with a in North 
                  Carolina. Went searching for fossilized teeth in the Mississippi gullies &lpar;and nearly lost a shoe&rpar;. The best 
                  by far was going 300 feet into one of the longest cave systems on the continent to see an historical sinkhole in person.</p>

               <h2>Playing video games</h2>
               <p>I've beem playing video games since I was 4 years old. My first system was the Super Nintendo but I also played on my 
                  Mom's Sega. Outside of Atari, I do believe I've played on every system after its creation...well except for GameBoys 
                  until the SP version. Either <em>Killer Instinct</em> or <em>Street Fighter</em> were the first games I played, but 
                  the <em>PageMaster</em> music still plays in my head. My dexterity was built for computers!</p>

               <h2>Photography</h2>
               <p>According to my baby pictures, I've been best friends with cameras since a young age. From diapers until now, I've 
                  either been in front of a camera or behind it <meta charset="ASCII-40">though my preference between the two have changed
                  <meta charset="ASCII-41">. I prefer to take pictures of nature and of unobstructed infastructures. I especially love sky 
                  pics. DSLR cameras are another addition to the friendship club.</p>

               <h2>Watching anime</h2>
               <p>In my younger days, I dabbled in anime. The first show I remember was Dragon Ball and I was only enamored because Goku 
                  had a tail. I was reintroduced to it in community college through a friend who had me spend the night so we could stay 
                  up and watch <em>Princess Mononoke</em>. Since then...binging became a habit and I could easily watch 10-20 episodes 
                  of any show that caught my interest. I've watched every episode of Dragon Ball that I know of until Dragon Ball GT, 
                  every episode of Naruto including the movies, Dororo is still my favorite and I love nearly any Miyazaki film. I will 
                  not say I'm anywhere near a master of anime, but my watching and reading list is extensive.</p>
